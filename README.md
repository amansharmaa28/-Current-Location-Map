# Features
. Leaflet Map Integration: The map is rendered using the Leaflet library, with tiles sourced from OpenStreetMap.

. Current Location Detection: The application uses the browser's geolocation feature to find and center the map on the user's current location.

. Draggable Marker: A marker is placed at the user's location, and it can be dragged to different positions.

. Location Circle: A circle with a radius of 100 meters is drawn around the user's location to indicate accuracy.
